Multi-Phase MRI Tumor Segmentation with Random Forests and Total-Variation Denoising

Built a voxel-wise supervised segmentation baseline using multi-phase MRI volumes (WI/AR/EV/LV): feature extraction (mono-phase vs multi-phase), scaling, Random Forest training, and evaluation with Dice scores. Added a denoising pre-processing step (TV Bregman) to assess its impact on segmentation quality. 

Completed as part of a group project.
